# Real-time-Face-mask-detector
Real time face mask detection using OpenCV and Deep Learning

## ABOUT
This is a binary image classification CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model trained on a [dataset](https://data-flair.training/blogs/download-face-mask-data/) containing aroung 1500 images of people with and without face-mask. The model is able to acheive 96.5% accuracy on the training set and 97% accuracy on the test set. The model efficiently predicts the classes when provided with a live video feed using OpenCV.
